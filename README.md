# Raspberry Pi Presence Sensor
Not much to explain here but I basically needed a way to turn off my smart display running on a Raspberry Pi when I wasn't around to save power and extend the life of the display. I run it as a cron job every 5 mins and it works beautifully but you may want to tweak the frequency and quiet hours set in the script itself. You'll also need to get the Bluetooth MAC address of your phone and throw that in for it to work.
